# mongo-crud-example
This project is a slight modification of the 
[Spring Boot Integration with MongoDB Tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/spring-boot) that
can be found on the MongoDB website.

I've incorporated the use of Lombok and have changed some settings to use a local version
of MongoDB instead of utilizing MongoDB Atlas.

The purpose of this project was to enhance my own understanding of using MongoDB with the 
Spring Framework and persist it to use as a reference and nothing more.

For a better understanding of this project, please refer to the tutorial mentioned above.
